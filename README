For those familiar with Git:

    git clone git@github.com:roofimon/tdd-using-spring.git


Once checked out, you can build from the command line using either Gradle or
Maven.  If you're new to Gradle, don't worry -- there's nothing for you to
install.  Simply use the 'gradlew' (or 'gradlew.bat' on windows) script within
the root directory of the project:

    >$ ./gradlew build

And the following will give you a list of all available tasks:

    >$ ./gradlew tasks

If necessary, this 'Gradle wrapper' script will download a distribution of
Gradle for you.

Generate project metadata appropriate to your IDE with

    >$ ./gradlew idea
